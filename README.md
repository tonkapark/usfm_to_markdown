# What is usfm_to_markdown?

This is a library of scripts used for personal projects that were working with 66 usfm files that had the entire text of the English Bible.

The idea is to process straight from usfm format to markdown formats for different use cases. Two use cases are started here, Jekyll static site and Obsidian

# Usage

In a directory on your machine put the Ruby script of choice and a usfm folder with one or more usfm files, one per book. Run the scripts and check the output folder for your files to move to your [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site or [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/).

`ruby convert-jekyll.rb`

`ruby convert-obsidian.rb`
